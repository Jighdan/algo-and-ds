# Singly Linked List
Linear Linked list is the default linked list and a linear data structure in which data is not stored in contiguous memory locations but each data node is connected to the next data node via a pointer, hence forming a chain.

## Internal Methods
### Push
Takes a value and appends a new node with that value to the Linked List.

### Pop
Removes and return the last node from the Linked List.

### Print
Returns an array with all the values from the Linked List.

## Algorithms
### Count
Counts the number of times a given int occurs in a list.

### GetNth
Takes an integer index and returns the data value stored in the node at that index position; if the index is greater than the length of the linked list, return `-1`.

### InsertNth
Inserts a new node at any index within a list, if the index is out of bounds, add the node to the tail.

### SortedInsert
Insert a new node at the correct sorted position

### InsertSort
Sorts a Linked List so they are organized in increasing order.

### Append
Takes another Linked List and appends it to the tail of the calling Linked List.

### Remove Duplicates
Takes an integer value and removes all the nodes from the Linked List that share the same value.

### Reverse
Sorts the Linked List in reverse order.
